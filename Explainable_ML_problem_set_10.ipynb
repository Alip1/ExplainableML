        "a. Demographic Parity:\n",
        "Explanation: Demographic parity aims to ensure that the distribution of positive outcomes is equal across different demographic groups (e.g., gender, race).\n",
        "When to Use: This model is suitable when there is a desire for equal representation of positive outcomes among different demographic groups, without considering individual characteristics.\n",
        "b. Equalized Odds:\n",
        "Explanation: Equalized odds focuses on ensuring that the true positive rate and false positive rate are equal across different demographic groups.\n",
        "When to Use: Use this model when you want to ensure that the predictive performance is consistent across different groups, particularly concerning both false positives and false negatives.\n",
        "c. Individual Fairness:\n",
        "Explanation: Individual fairness considers the idea that similar individuals should be treated similarly. It assesses the similarity between individuals based on various features.\n",
        "When to Use: Individual fairness is useful when you want to ensure that the model treats similar individuals similarly, regardless of their demographic group.\n",

        "Plot the first 10 rows of the dataset along with the column names to visualize the data structure."

        "In-processing:\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantage: Bias mitigation is integrated directly into the model training process. This allows the model to adapt and learn fair representations during training.\n",
        "Disadvantage: Some in-processing methods may require more computational resources. It may also be challenging to find a universally effective algorithm due to variations in dataset characteristics.\n",
        "Post-processing:\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantage: Model predictions are adjusted after the model is trained, providing flexibility in applying fairness constraints without modifying the core training algorithm.\n",

        "Advantages and Disadvantages of Bias Mitigation Methods:\n",
        "Preprocessing:\n",
        "Advantages:\n",
        "Simplicity: Preprocessing methods are often easy to implement and understand.\n",
        "Independence: They can be used with any classification algorithm.\n",
        "Disadvantages:\n",
        "Lack of Nuance: May oversimplify the problem by addressing bias at the dataset level without considering the complexity of the model.\n",
        "In-processing:\n",
        "Advantages:\n",
        "Integration: Bias mitigation is part of the model training process, allowing the model to adapt and learn fair representations.\n",
        "Real-time Adjustments: Can make real-time adjustments during training based on evolving data.\n",
        "Disadvantages:\n",
        "Algorithm Dependence: Efficacy may depend on the specific algorithm used, and there may not be a one-size-fits-all solution.\n",
        "Post-processing:\n",
        "Advantages:\n",
        "Flexibility: Allows adjustments to be made to model predictions after training.\n",

        "Disadvantages:\n",
        "Limited Correction: May be less effective in cases where the underlying model has learned deeply ingrained biases.\n",
        "Lack of Adaptability: Cannot influence the core model training process.\n",
